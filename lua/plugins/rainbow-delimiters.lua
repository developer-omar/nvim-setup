-- This Neovim plugin provides alternating syntax highlighting (“rainbow parentheses”)
-- for Neovim, powered by Tree-sitter. The goal is to have a hackable plugin which allows
-- for different configuration of queries and strategies, both globally and per file type.
-- Users can override and extend the built-in defaults through their own configuration.
